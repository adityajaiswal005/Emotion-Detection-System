# 🎭 Emotion Detection System using Machine Learning

This is a **Text-based Emotion Detection System** built using **Python, NLP (Natural Language Processing)**, and **Machine Learning**.  
It detects emotions like **joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, and surprise** from any given text input and visualizes prediction confidence through a **bar chart** in a **Streamlit web app**.


---

## 🧠 Overview

The Emotion Detection System uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and a **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict human emotions from text.  
It includes:
- A machine learning backend model
- A clean Streamlit-based user interface
- Bar chart visualization of emotion confidence (ranging from 0 to 1)

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Predicts emotions from text input  
✅ Clean and simple Streamlit UI  
✅ Static Matplotlib bar chart showing confidence scores  
✅ High accuracy text classification using NLP  
✅ Pre-trained model and vectorizer are reusable (`.pkl` files)  
✅ Customizable for your own dataset
